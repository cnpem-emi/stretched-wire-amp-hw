# Enclosure panels for amplifier of stretched-wire test bench 

Set of lateral panels and mounting base for the shielding enclosure from low-noise amplifier used on the stretched-wire test bench from [IMA group](https://github.com/lnls-ima).

These panels were drawn as PCB's in Altium so they could be easily fabricated in PCB milling systems.
